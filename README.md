At Science Hack Day Berlin 2018 we build a Gender Pay Gap Clock

 HARDWARE:
 
-  Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 (an Aduino-like board with a Wifi-module)
- An 28-BYJ48 stepper motor with a Motor driver board
-Micro USB-cable and Power supply 
-clockwork from IKEA kitchen Clock at least 30 years (Made in West Germany) :D
- Some jumper wires
-white acrylic thickness 3 mm, and some PLA for the 3D print


For the clock:
    - Laser cut acrylic box and clock face
    - 3D printed clock hands
    
    
SOFTWARE:
    
 
software and case design of the clock see github: https://github.com/robertricht/Gender-Pay-Gap-Clock 
the software code is in the file " Clock"
and the case design is in the files "caseplans_5.dxf" and "shbd_clock_3.dxf" 
    
you can use the case design files directly to laser cut the case of the clock
    
a few photos on google drive here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-0ONhQ9K6TXJNCaYShgiN-4uGz3kpYcs
if you want to open the dxf files you could use illustrator from adobe

in the pictures you can see how it is built

have fun :-)
